# Dotfiles

Dotfiles managed with `stow` for easy install on new machines.

## Dependencies

Here are the packages that I use in this configuration:

```
stow neovim tmux bash starship fzf ttf-input sway swaybg zoxide git rustup
lua-language-server clangd tree-sitter tree-sitter-cli ripgrep
```

Make sure they are installed with your favourite package manager.
